# Objects, Immutability and Switch Expressions
1. **Checking `null` references in functional style and imperative code**: Write a program that performs the `null` checks on the given references in a functional style and imperative code.
2. **Checking `null` references and throwing a customized `NullPointerException` error**: Write a program that performs the `null` checks on the given references and throws `NullPointerException` with custom messages.
3. **Checking `null` references and throwing the specified exception (example, `IllegalArgumentException`)**: Write a program that performs the null checks on the given references and throws the specified exception.
5. **Checking `null` references and returning non-null default references**: Write a program that performs the null checks on the given reference, and if it is non-null, then return it; otherwise, return a non-null default reference.
6. **Checking the index in the range from 0 to length**: Write a program that checks whether the given index is between 0 (inclusive) and the given length (exclusive). If the given index is out of the [0, given length] range, then throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
7. **Checking the sub-range in the range from 0 to length**: Write a program that checks whether the given sub-range [given start, given end] is within the bounds of the range from [0, given length]. If the given sub-range is not in the [0, given length] range, then throw `IndexOutOfBoundsException`.
8. **`equals()` and `hashCode()`**: Explain and exemplify how `equals()` and `hashCode()` methods work in Java.
9. **Immutable objects in a nutshell**: Explain and exemplify what is an immutable object in Java.
10. **Immutable string**: Explain why the `String` class is immutable.
11. **Writing an immutable class**: Write a program that represents an immutable class.
12. **Passing/returning mutable objects to/from an immutable class**: Write a program that passes and returns a mutable object to/from an immutable class.
13. **Writing an immutable class via the Builder pattern**: Write a program that represents an implementation of the Builder pattern in an immutable class.
14. **Avoiding bad data in immutable objects**: Write a program that prevents bad data in immutable objects.
15. **Cloning objects**: Write a program that exemplifies shallow and deep cloning techniques.
16. **Overriding `toString()`**: Explain and exemplify practices for overriding `toString()`.
17. **`switch` expressions**: Provide a brief overview of the switch expressions in JDK 12.
18. **Multiple case labels**: Write a snippet of code for exemplifying the JDK 12 switch with multiple case labels.
19. **Statement blocks**: Write a snippet of code for exemplifying the JDK 12 switch with case labels that point to a curly-braced block.
